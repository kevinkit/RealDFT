RealDFT
=======

Small librariy for DFT, Idft, Convolution.
The dft will just work for real signals. You put in an integer vector and you'll get back a twodimensional matrix mapped on one vector where vec[i << 1]=Re   and vec[(i << 1) + 1]=Im


You only need the gnu compiler.
You have to compile it with including the math-libray ( -lm )
